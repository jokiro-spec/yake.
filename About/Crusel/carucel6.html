        <p>Course Descriptions In the following listings, courses numbered 110 through 499 are studio electives offered to students from
           Yale College and the graduate and professional schools. Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment in all courses.
            Graduate students of the School of Art who wish to broaden their experience outside their area of concentration have priority
             in enrollment. Courses numbered 500 and above are offered only to graduate students of the School of Art. In exceptional 
             cases qualified Yale College students may enroll in a graduate course, with the permission of both the instructor and the 
             director of undergraduate studies. Please refer to the section on Academic Regulations for further pertinent details.
              It should be noted that, as a matter of policy, all faculty members teach on both the graduate and undergraduate levels, 
              although the degree and the nature of contact may vary. Tutorials, which are special courses that cannot be obtained through 
              regular class content, require a proposal written by the student and the faculty member concerned, defining both content and 
              requirements. Proposals must be presented to the Academic Subcommittee for approval.</p><br>

        <p>Off Campus Housing Resources.<br>
          •	Yale is home to 6,500 Graduate and Professional School students, many of whom prefer
           to live off campus. The University offers limited on-campus housing
            options for graduate and PhD students, so the Yale Housing Office 
            maintains a portal with Off-Campus Listings in which the property 
            owners are verified.
•	We recommend starting there, or with listings that will be updated on this
 page from within the School of Art community, or on the closed Facebook Group. As you look for
  apartments Yale recommends trying to stay within the Yale Shuttle routes to benefit from this service as well 
  as campus safety resources such as the LiveSafe app, but this is of course up to you.<br>
