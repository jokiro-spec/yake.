  <p>
This website is the continuously evolving effort of many people from many disciplines within the Yale School of Art 
and its wider circles. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_School_of_Art" target="_blank">wiki</a>, meaning
 that every graduate student, staff person, and faculty member of the School can change this website’s content or add to it
  at any time. (Logins for other friends, alums, and members of the school are coming soon.)
  </p>
  <p>
When you click “Edit this page” on any page, you’ll be prompted to log in using your Yale ID. Then you can proceed to make
 changes or additions to that page, which everyone else will see.
  </p>
  <p>
For practical reasons, not everyone in or associated with the School has access to edit every part of every page. For 
example, while students may offer their views on a course’s page, or add information or resources, they cannot create
official course descriptions. (At the moment, locked areas and content types are the exception rather than the rule.)
  </p>
  <p>
That said, we, as a collaborative community, are confident that the information on this website is as reliable as that on
any website and more open to diverse voices and perspectives than most. In order that it remains so the site’s interactivity
is to be used freely but wisely. As you move through it you may, in consequence of such openness, encounter content that
surprises you or with which you don’t agree. That will be the sign that this website reflects life in our institution in
all its heterogeneous dimensions.
